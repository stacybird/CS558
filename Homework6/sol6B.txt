********** PARSING ******************
Program:
((global n 7)
 (global b True)
 (global p (pair 5 True))
 (global l (cons 3 (cons 4 (cons 9 nil))))
 (global c 'a'))
(+ n 1)

********** Type Checking *************

n::Int
b::Bool
p::(Int . Bool)
l::[Int]
c::Char

******** LOADING DEFS **************
n b p l c

********** EXECUTING BODY **********
8

*********** ENTERING READ EVAL PRINT ***************
type ':q' to exit, type 'trace' to flip tracer state
